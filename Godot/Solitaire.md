# The idea
So, I realize, I actually don't know how to play solitaire. So, here I am going to do some research. Starting with...

Sooooooooooo, solitaire is more complex than I realize.

However, at its core, solitaire is taking a deck of cards and sorting them into their various suits in order from least to greatest; With some caveats:
1. Each card among 7 piles can only be placed on an opposite color card or be moved into the foundation pile (the core sorting of the 4 suits).
2. You can only pick up a card from the lowest stack in the pile.
3. You can pull a card down from the foundation pile to help you stack.
>[!NOTE] Setup
>To setup the initial 7 piles, you place down one card at a time forming the beginning of the stack. Then you move on stack over and begin to place the next 6 cards. Then do the same doing the next 5 cards and so on. Once you get to the final card you leave the stack of cards to slowly pull from to move the game along.

## What's needed
To form the foundation of the game you need the folowing items to make a bare minimum playable game.
- [ ] Movable cards
- [ ] A deck
	- [ ] Randomized
	- [ ] Pullable (Take out cards)
	- [ ] 52 Individual Cards With Suits
- [ ] A basic win state

# Hiatus
Solitiare is very boring and it's too complex to solve. So, I'm leaving this under hiatus until I can have an easier time working on this or if I suddenly feel like torturing myself.
