# Parts I felt needed polish
## Mobile Devices
- Laptops
	- Backlight inverter
		- If the monitor is super dim and the brightness doesn't seem to be able to increase. It's likely the backlight inverter.
- Screens
	- LCD (Liquid Crystal Diode)
		- There are two kinds

		- Hybrid Tech
		- Better everything
- Ports
	- Serial
		- Sometimes referred to as COM or RS232 & DB9
- Mobile Device Application Support
	- Microsoft ActiveSync
		- Gets all devices including iPhones set up from a central location (like gmail and even have corperate control)
	- Mobile Device Management (MDM)
		- This is control of multiple devices in a central place

- Fios
	- Fiber Optic
- SDN: Programmatically configure the network
### Wireless Protocols
- 2.4 GHz: Includes Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cordless Devices, and Medical Devices
	- 13 Channels: 11 channels in North America, three that don't overlap
- 5 GHz: Has less saturation and wider channels through bonding
	- The channels on these don't overlap like 2.4GHz

	- 13.56 MHz (megahertz)
- RFID:
	- Not to be confused with NFC
	- These are tags (Powered and Unpowered)
	- Powered Tags can have up to 100 meters of range
### Network Hosts and Services
- Directory Server: Authentication Servers
	- E.g. Microsoft ActiveDirectory
- Print Server
	- Central Place to put all printers into so entire building can access the same drivers
- Internet Appliances
	- Unified Threat Management (UTM) appliance
		- Expensive
		- Takes multiple Security functions into one device
	- Load balancers.
	- Proxy Server
- SCADA
	- Collection of components
	- E.g. control systems, power grids, water grids, etc
### DNS (Domain Name System)
- FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name)
- Name Resolution Process:
	- Hosts file
	- Local resolver cache.
	- DNS servers: Root first, top-level domain (TLD), system landscape directory (SLD):
		- Locally configured DNS server: private or internet service provider (ISP) DNS server.
		- Root hint.
		- TLD.
		- SLD or host's domain (SLD, typically organizations)
- DNS database and records
	- A
		- IPv4
	- AAAA
		- IPv6
	- MX (Mail Exchanger)
		- This is the IP that handles all emails on the domain's behalf
	- TXT
		- Plain text record
		- Allows for DKIM, DMARC, etc
### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- DHCP Lease Process: Temporary Assignment of an IP to a host
	- Step 1: Discover
		- Send out a signal for all DHCP servers to give a response with configs
	- Step 2: Offer
		- Any DHCP server that hears this request will respond with config
	- Step 3: Request
		- The host tells the first server that responds that it's requested its config
	- Step 4: Acknowledge
		- DHCP marks it as registered in its system with lease and a timestamp
- DHCP Scope
	- The range of IP addresses that is allowed to be leased to hosts
- Reservations
	- Like a static IP but managed by the DHCP server. Allows you to keep specific IPs for specific hosts.
### IP Address Configuration
- Subnet Mask: A binary number to identify what network the computers are on.
	- E.g. <mark>255.255.255</mark>.0
	     <mark>192.168.0</mark>.10
> [!Note]
> The highlighted portion is the network ID and the portions after are the "host portion"
- IPv4 Classes
	- Public Ranges
		- Class A: 1.0.0.0–127.255.255.255
		- Class B: 128.0.0.1–191.255.255.255
		- Class C: 192.0.0.0–223.255.255.255
	- Private Ranges:
		- Class A: 10.0.0.0–10.255.255.255
		- Class B: 172.16.0.0–172.31.255.255
		- Class C: 192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255
	- Reserved Addresses:
		- APIPA address: 169.254.x.y
			- This is used as a fallback if a DHCP connection fails
			- APIPA hosts can only communicate with other APIPA
- IPv4 vs IPv6
	- IPv4
		- 32-bit
		- dotted decimal
		- 4 octets
		- limited addresses
	- IPv6
		- 128-bit
		- Colon separated hexadecimal
		- 8 blocks
		- Massive address space
- IPv6 Specifics
	- <mark>::</mark> means that 3 continuous blocks of 0000 are truncated
		- This cannot appear twice, if it does, then it's not IPv6
		- fe80 is also not a part of the first block of IPv6 it's considered a "link-local" address indicator
		- Leading zeroes in each block can also be left out, and it is still valid
		- E.g. fe80::c53c:41f2:564f:6d3a
	- Types of IPv6 addresses
		- Global
		- Unique Local
		- Link-Local
### Internet Connection Types
- Fiber (Optic)
- Cable
	- Shared Connection with other people in the area and can slow down when other people in the area use it.
- Dial-Up
	- Telephone line (Low-speed) but disaster recovery often use this since they're first to go up.
	- Can't use phone while using internet
- DSL
	- This is also a telephone line but allows you to use both phone and internet
	- Max distance of 8000 feet
	- ADSL is different upload and download speeds.
- Cellular
	- Same internet as smartphones
- Satellite
- WISP
	- Like cellular
	- Sses mixed tech
	- Line of sight comms
### Network Types
- Personal Area Network (PAN)
	- E.g. Bluetooth and Phone
- LAN (Local Area Network)
	- Network in a single geographic location
	- Private Links
- VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)
	- A way to divide a switch into multiple switches
	- This allows for only certain devices to be able to communicate with certain other devices within a network.
- WAN (Wide Area Network)
	- Spans multiple geolocations
	- Using ISP internet links
	- This connects something like 2 homes together
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
	- This is a network that only stays within city limits
- SAN (Storage Area Network)
	- Highly optimized fiber comms to combine storage connections
	- Usually in enterprise
- NAS
### Network Tools
- Cable Stripper
	- Remove coating of cables like shield
- Cable Crimper
	- These are to hold together wires for things like RJ-45
	- Coaxial crimpers are also a thing
- Cable Tester
	- You plug ends of a cable like RJ-45 to see if the cables are connected correctly
- Toner Probe (Wire Tracker)
	- This helps find the correct cable in a bundle of cables in a server closet
- Punchdown Tool
	- This is for patch panels
	- Make sure you have it facing the correct direction
- Loopback Plug
	- It's an RJ-45 connector that connects back in on itself to test that it can send a signal back to itself.
- Network Tap
	- Expensive device that lets you listen on comms from one destination to another to see the data that's passing through cable.
- Wifi analyzer
	- Let's you read traffic on wifi network
# Hardware
- Copper Media
	- Twisted Pair Cabling
		- 8 Copper Conductors
		- 4 Twisted Pairs
		- Twists are to protect against electromagnetic interference
		- UTP vs. STP
			- Unshielded Twisted Pair
			- Shielded Twisted Pair
		- RJ-45 Jack to connect the pairs
		- Adding something like a RJ-45 is called "terminating"
		- Plenum vs Nonplenum
			- PVC (Polyfenel Chloride?) also known as non plenum jacketing when burnt releases toxic gas
			- Plenum is for firecode non toxic
